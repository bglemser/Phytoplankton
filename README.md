## Description

Our project is based on the following kaggle competition:

The goal of the competition is the automated classification of plankton images. These images were optained by towing an underwater camera in the Strait of Florida between May-June 2014. 

### Task Type

Image Classification

### Results Summary

#### Best Model Performance
- **Best Model:** [Name and type of the best-performing model"]
- **Evaluation Metric:** [Primary metric used, e.g., Accuracy, F1-Score, MSE, MAE]
- **Final Performance:** [Best score achieved, e.g., 95% accuracy, F1-score of 0.87, MSE of 0.12]

#### Model Comparison
- **Baseline Performance:** [Baseline model performance for comparison]
- **Improvement Over Baseline:** [Quantitative improvement, e.g., "+12% accuracy", "25% reduction in MSE"]
- **Best Alternative Model:** [Second-best model and its performance]

#### Key Insights
- **Most Important Features:** [Top 3-5 features that drive model performance]
- **Model Strengths:** [What the model does well]
- **Model Limitations:** [Known limitations and failure cases]
- **Business Impact:** [Practical implications of the model performance]
