**Summary of Each Work**:

- **Source 1**: Convolutional neural networks and vision transformers for Plankton Classification

  - **[Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S157495412500281X)**
  - **Objective**:
  -  Study tries out ensembles combining different Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models and transformer architectures to see if they enhange plankton recognition
  -  Can different optimization algorithms result in more robust and efficient classification across various plankton datasets?
  - **Methods**:
  - fine-tuning of established neural network architectures, all initialized with ImageNet pre-trained weights
  - exploring multiple Adam-based optimizers
  - **Outcomes**:
  - successfully built a deep learning methodology based on Faster R-CNN, a two-stage detector,
  - one-stage detectors are not suitable for microscopy phytoplankton images
  - **Relation to the Project**:
  - Investigated many of the CNN architectures we used
  - using phytoplankton datasets
  - But images could hold several species, so object detection and then classification was used --> we only need classification
